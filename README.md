# MLA-Course
Machine Learning Algorithms | AITU

# FYI - Additional resources
- [Kaggle courses for data science](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) - easy and short, for basic topics of DS, practice-oriented
- [Coursera Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) - must-have courses, covers all main topics of classic ML, theory-oriented
- [DataCamp courses](https://www.datacamp.com/) - a lot of short DS courses stacked in professional tracks, practice-oriented
- [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - best courses to dive into deep learning, theory-oriented
- [PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/start-here/) - if you want to look at what can be done by Computer Vision, practice-oriented

For gentle introduction I recommend to start from Kaggle courses and if you interest in it then continue with Coursera ML Spec.

Additionaly I recommend to check salaries in Data Science and negative moments of working in this field (f.e. unpredictable development based on experiments)

Good luck!
